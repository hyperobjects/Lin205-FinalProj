Final Project<br>

<H1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
Choose an author and download a couple of his or her books from Project Gutenberg. Next, extract this author’s word bigrams, i.e. all two-word sequences. For instance, in the sentecen "cats like eating fish" we have 3 bigrams: [("cats", "like"), ("like", "eating"), ("eating", "fish")]. Write a program which generates random sentences given your chosen author’s bigram model. Given a previous word w, it should choose randomly from the words which follow w in the bigram model.

<h2> Input:</h2>
Ebooks downloaded from Project Gutenberg 
<h2> Output:</h2>
Randomly generated sentence using the author’s bigram probabilities
